        <p>
            Cerastes cerastes, commonly known as the Saharan horned viper or the desert horned viper, is a venomous species of viper native to the deserts of Northern Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula and Levant. It is often easily recognized by the presence of a pair of supraocular "horns", although hornless individuals do occur. They typically move by sidewinding, during which they press their weight into the sand or soil, leaving whole-body impressions. Often, it is even possible to use these impressions to make ventral scale counts. They have a reasonably placid temperament, but if threatened, they may assume a C-shaped posture and rapidly rub their coils together. Because they have strongly keeled scales, this rubbing produces a rasping noise, similar to the sound produced by snakes of the genus Echis. In the wild, they are typically ambush predators, lying submerged in sand adjacent to rocks or under vegetation. The diet of this carnivorous species consists primarily of small rodents, geckos, birds, and a variety of lizards. These vipers are also known to eat jerboas, yellow wagtails, and chiffchaffs. C. cerastes has been known to travel long distances at night in search of prey. When approached, they strike very rapidly, holding on to the captured prey until the venom takes effect.

        <p>
            The emerald tree boa (Corallus caninus) is a boa species found in the rainforests of South America. Since 2009 the species Corallus batesii has been distinguished from the emerald tree boa. Like all other boas, it is nonvenomous. The color pattern typically consists of an emerald green ground color with a white irregular interrupted zigzag stripe or so-called 'lightning bolts' down the back and a yellow belly. The bright coloration and markings are very distinctive among South American snakes. Juveniles vary in color between various shades of light and dark orange or brick-red before ontogenetic coloration sets in and the animals turn emerald green (after 9â€“12 months of age). This also occurs in green tree python (Morelia viridis), a python species in which hatchlings and juveniles may also be canary yellow or brick-red. As opposed to popular belief, yellow juveniles (as in the green tree python) do not occur in the emerald tree boa. The diet consists primarily of small mammals, but they have been known to eat some smaller bird species as well as lizards and frogs. Due to the extremely slow metabolism of this species, it feeds much less often than ground dwelling species and meals may be several months apart.

        <p>
            Trimeresurus insularis or Indonesian pit viper, Lesser Sunda Islands pit viper, Sunda white-lipped pit viper, red-tailed pit viper is a venomous pit viper species found in eastern Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. A venomous species. The Insular Pit Viper can be found as blue, yellow or green individuals with yellow or white ventrals. Eye color can also vary from grey to red to yellow. All individuals will have a red, orange or light red tail. Scales are keeled and head is wide at teh jaw which is distinct from the neck. Active at night and occasionally resting in bushes during the day. The Insular Pit Viper is an ambush predator that will wait in a single position ready to strike. They are a viper and have relatively long retractable fangs and will bite readily at anything that comes within range. Generally not prone to give chase but will hold their ground if they feel cornered. Not actively aggressive but will not hesitate to bite. A bite from an Insular Pit Viper should be considered very serious and medical attention should be sought immediately. Although not known to be deadly serious damage can occur from a bite even if treated and complications can always arise.
